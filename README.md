# Build Your Own Shell

A Unix shell built from scratch — command parsing, execution, piping, and job control.

## Scope
- REPL with prompt and line editing
- Command parsing and execution (fork/exec)
- Pipes (`|`) and redirects (`>`, `<`, `>>`)
- Environment variables and expansion
- Built-ins: `cd`, `exit`, `export`, `history`
- Job control (`&`, `fg`, `bg`) — stretch goal

## Learning Goals
- Process creation (fork/exec/wait)
- File descriptors and I/O redirection
- Signal handling
- Lexing and parsing command syntax
- How your terminal actually works
